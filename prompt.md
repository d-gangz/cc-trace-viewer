1. Read and understand the implementation plan in @implementation-plan.md
2. Read the docs @custom-ui-context/monsterui-conventions.md and @custom-ui-context/fasthtml-conventions.md to understand more about FastHTML and MonsterUI which will be used to build it.
3. Use context7 mcp to retrieve the relevant FastHTML or MonsterUI docs if you dont understand anything.
4. Implement the plan and build the product out.
