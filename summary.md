# Claude Code Trace Viewer - Development Summary

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user requested comprehensive UI improvements and enhancements to the Claude Code trace viewer application across multiple sessions:

### Session 1 - Initial Requirements:
- Display all sessions from `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- Show sessions ordered by date/time (most recent first)
- Display entire trace/conversation when clicking a session
- Make the application portable for any user
- Accurate timezone handling and conversion
- Filter out incomplete/summary-only sessions

### Session 2 - UI Enhancement Requests:
1. **Trace Tree UI Improvements**:
   - Remove circle icons from trace rows
   - Limit text to max 2 lines with proper truncation
   - Remove timestamps on the right
   - Adjust layout to 30% trace tree / 70% event details
   - Show full session ID (not truncated)
   - Remove bold text styling
   - Add keyboard navigation (up/down arrows)
   - Flush text to left without margins

2. **Tool Call/Result Enhancements**:
   - Display "tool call" in yellow for tool_use events
   - Display "tool result" in green for tool_result events with tool name lookup
   - Show tool name by finding matching tool_use_id across events

3. **Event Details Redesign**:
   - Remove Event/Timestamp/ID sections (keep Event Data at bottom)
   - Add structured Content section with scenario-based rendering
   - Add Metrics section displaying usage data
   - Add base64 image rendering support

4. **Navigation & Layout**:
   - Auto-select first trace event on page load
   - Move "Back" button to header (top left, same row as title)
   - Make hover colors consistent across home and viewer pages
   - Remove border divider below main title

### Session 3 - Homepage and Layout Improvements:
1. **Homepage Project Timestamps**:
   - Add "X time ago" timestamp to each project (rightmost side)
   - Sort projects by most recent session (descending order)
   - Use text-gray-500 with regular font weight for timestamps

2. **Panel Consolidation**:
   - Combine trace tree and event details into single bordered container
   - Remove gap between panels, use single dividing line
   - Match dividing line color to card border color
   - Remove "Trace Tree" heading from left panel
   - Fix bottom gap in trace tree panel to flush with bottom

3. **Session Header Enhancement**:
   - Use H4 with uk-h4 class for session ID
   - Add project path on rightmost side with text-gray-500
   - Use DivFullySpaced for proper spacing

4. **Panel Height Adjustment**:
   - Increase panel height from 70vh to 75vh for better visibility

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- **FastHTML**: Modern Python web framework for building web applications
- **MonsterUI**: UI component library for FastHTML (Card, CardContainer, CardBody components)
- **HTMX**: Dynamic content loading without page refreshes
- **Timezone-aware datetime handling**: Converting UTC timestamps to local time
- **JSONL format**: Line-delimited JSON for session traces
- **CSS line-clamp**: Text truncation with `-webkit-line-clamp: 2`
- **Flexbox layout**: For 30/70 width distribution and panel alignment
- **JavaScript event listeners**: Keyboard navigation and auto-selection
- **Tool ID correlation**: Matching tool_result events to tool_use events via tool_use_id
- **Scenario-based rendering**: Different UI rendering based on content type
- **Word wrapping**: `whitespace-pre-wrap` and `break-words` for proper text display
- **CSS Variables**: Using `var(--uk-border-default)` for consistent theming
- **Height vs max-height**: Understanding difference for panel sizing
- **MonsterUI Card Architecture**: Card wraps content in CardBody which adds padding

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### main.py

**Purpose**: Main application file containing the FastHTML web server and all trace viewer logic.

#### Recent Changes (Session 3):

**1. ProjectAccordion Function - Homepage Timestamps and Sorting**

Added timestamp display to project accordion titles and enabled project sorting:

```python
def ProjectAccordion(project_name: str, sessions: List[Session]):
    """Accordion item for a project with its sessions"""
    session_items = []
    for session in sessions:
        relative_time = get_relative_time(session.created_at)
        session_items.append(
            Li(
                A(
                    DivFullySpaced(
                        Span(session.session_id, cls=TextT.bold),
                        Span(relative_time, cls="text-gray-500 font-normal"),  # Changed styling
                    ),
                    href=f"/viewer/{session.session_id}",
                    cls="hover:bg-gray-800 p-2 rounded block",
                )
            )
        )

    # Get most recent session timestamp for this project
    most_recent = max(sessions, key=lambda s: s.created_at)
    project_time = get_relative_time(most_recent.created_at)

    return Li(
        A(
            DivFullySpaced(
                Span(project_name),
                Span(project_time, cls="text-gray-500 font-normal"),  # Project timestamp
            ),
            cls="uk-accordion-title font-bold",
        ),
        Div(Ul(*session_items, cls="space-y-1 mt-2"), cls="uk-accordion-content"),
    )
```

**Why important**:
- Displays project timestamp based on most recent session
- Uses consistent gray styling for all timestamps
- Enables users to quickly see project activity

**2. Index Route - Project Sorting**

Added sorting logic to display most recently active projects first:

```python
@rt
def index():
    """Home page with project accordion"""
    sessions = discover_sessions()

    if not sessions:
        return Layout(
            Card(
                P("No session files found in ~/.claude/sessions/", cls=TextT.muted),
                cls="mt-8",
            )
        )

    projects = group_sessions_by_project(sessions)

    # Sort projects by most recent session (descending)
    sorted_projects = sorted(
        projects.items(),
        key=lambda item: max(s.created_at for s in item[1]),
        reverse=True
    )

    accordion_items = [
        ProjectAccordion(project_name, project_sessions)
        for project_name, project_sessions in sorted_projects
    ]

    return Layout(
        Div(
            H2("Projects & Sessions", cls="mb-4"),
            Ul(
                *accordion_items, cls="uk-accordion", data_uk_accordion="multiple: true"
            ),
            cls="mt-8",
        )
    )
```

**Why important**:
- Sorts projects by most recent activity
- Improves UX by showing active projects first
- Uses max() to find most recent session in each project

**3. Viewer Route - Unified Panel Layout**

Consolidated trace tree and event details into single bordered container:

```python
@rt("/viewer/{session_id}")
def viewer(session_id: str):
    """Trace viewer page with tree and detail panel"""
    # Find session file in project directories
    sessions = discover_sessions()
    session_file = None
    project_name = None
    for session in sessions:
        if session.session_id == session_id:
            session_file = session.file_path
            project_name = session.project_name
            break

    if not session_file or not session_file.exists():
        return Layout(
            Card(
                P(f"Session file not found: {session_id}", cls=TextT.muted), cls="mt-8"
            )
        )

    trace_tree = parse_session_file(session_file)

    tree_nodes = [TraceTreeNode(event, session_id, trace_tree) for event in trace_tree]

    return Layout(
        Div(
            # Session header with project path
            DivFullySpaced(
                H4(f"Session: {session_id}", cls="uk-h4"),
                Span(project_name, cls="text-gray-500 font-normal"),
            ),
            # Combined panel with single border - using CardContainer directly
            CardContainer(
                Div(
                    # Left panel - Trace tree (30% width)
                    Div(
                        Div(
                            *(
                                tree_nodes
                                if tree_nodes
                                else [P("No trace events found", cls=TextT.muted)]
                            ),
                            cls="overflow-auto",
                            style="max-height: 75vh;",
                        ),
                        cls="p-4",
                        style="width: 30%; border-right: 1px solid var(--uk-border-default); height: 75vh;",
                    ),
                    # Right panel - Detail view (70% width)
                    Div(
                        H3("Event Details", cls="mb-4 font-bold"),
                        Div(
                            P("Select an event to view details", cls=TextT.muted),
                            id="detail-panel",
                            cls="overflow-auto",
                            style="max-height: 75vh",
                        ),
                        cls="p-4",
                        style="width: 70%",
                    ),
                    style="display: flex;",
                ),
                cls="mt-4",
            ),
        ),
        show_back_button=True,
    )
```

**Why important**:
- Uses CardContainer instead of Card to avoid automatic CardBody padding
- Single border around both panels with dividing line using `var(--uk-border-default)`
- Left panel has fixed `height: 75vh` to prevent bottom gap
- Removed "Trace Tree" heading for cleaner layout
- Added project path to session header
- Session header uses H4 with uk-h4 class and DivFullySpaced for layout

### summary.md

**Purpose**: Development summary documenting all features, changes, and decisions made during the project.

**Status**: Being updated with Session 3 changes (homepage timestamps, panel consolidation, session header improvements)

## 4. Problem Solving

### Problems Solved in Session 3:

1. **Project Timestamp Display**:
   - **Problem**: Needed to show when each project was last active
   - **Solution**: Extract most recent session timestamp from sessions list using `max(sessions, key=lambda s: s.created_at)`
   - **Implementation**: Added timestamp to both project accordion titles and individual session entries

2. **Project Sorting**:
   - **Problem**: Projects displayed in alphabetical order, not by activity
   - **Solution**: Sort projects dict by max session timestamp in descending order
   - **Code**: `sorted(projects.items(), key=lambda item: max(s.created_at for s in item[1]), reverse=True)`

3. **Panel Border Consolidation**:
   - **Problem**: Trace tree and event details had separate borders with gap between them
   - **Solution**: Wrap both panels in single CardContainer instead of separate Card components
   - **Why**: Card automatically wraps content in CardBody which adds padding, CardContainer is just the outer shell

4. **Border Color Mismatch**:
   - **Problem**: Dividing line color (rgb(55, 65, 81)) didn't match card border
   - **Solution**: Use CSS variable `var(--uk-border-default)` for consistent theming
   - **Research**: Used context7 MCP to understand MonsterUI Card component structure

5. **Trace Tree Bottom Gap**:
   - **Problem**: Left panel had visible gap at bottom, not flush like right panel
   - **Root Cause**: Using `max-height` without fixed container height
   - **Solution**: Set outer div to `height: 75vh` and inner scrollable to `max-height: 75vh`
   - **Failed Attempts**:
     - Tried `min-height` which caused overflow
     - Tried removing `max-height` which caused layout issues
     - Moving padding from outer to inner div didn't fix the gap

6. **Session Header Layout**:
   - **Problem**: Needed to display both session ID and project path in header
   - **Solution**: Use DivFullySpaced with H4 for session ID and Span for project path
   - **Styling**: H4 uses uk-h4 class, project path uses text-gray-500 with regular weight

7. **Panel Height Visibility**:
   - **Problem**: Original 70vh height too small for comfortable viewing
   - **Solution**: Increased both panels to 75vh for better content visibility

## 5. Previous Session Bug Fixes

### MCP Tool Result Rendering Bug (Fixed in Session 2)

**Problem**: When clicking on tool_result events for MCP tools (e.g., `mcp__puppeteer__puppeteer_navigate`), the Event Details panel would show an Internal Server Error instead of the correct event data.

**Root Cause**: The `toolUseResult` field has different data types:
- **Native tools**: dict/object (e.g., `{"shellId": "...", "command": "..."}`)
- **MCP tools**: list/array (e.g., `[{"type": "text", "text": "..."}]`)

**Solution**: Added type checking to handle both formats in DetailPanel function.

### Base64 Image Rendering Feature (Added in Session 2)

**Problem**: Base64-encoded images displayed as raw JSON data instead of actual images.

**Solution**: Implemented image rendering in three locations:
1. User/assistant message content arrays
2. Tool result content arrays
3. toolUseResult field for MCP tools

## 6. Pending Tasks

**None** - All requested features have been implemented.

## 7. Current Work

**Session Header and Project Path Display**

The most recent work completed was updating the session viewer header:

**Changes Made** (main.py lines 794-823):
1. Modified viewer route to capture `project_name` from session lookup
2. Replaced single H3 session title with DivFullySpaced layout:
   - Left: H4 with `uk-h4` class showing session ID
   - Right: Span with project path in gray (text-gray-500, font-normal)
3. Panel height increased from 70vh to 75vh for better visibility

**Code snippet**:
```python
return Layout(
    Div(
        DivFullySpaced(
            H4(f"Session: {session_id}", cls="uk-h4"),
            Span(project_name, cls="text-gray-500 font-normal"),
        ),
        # Combined panel with single border...
        CardContainer(
            # Left panel with height: 75vh
            # Right panel with max-height: 75vh
        )
    ),
    show_back_button=True,
)
```

**Previous work in this session**:
1. ✅ Added timestamps to homepage projects (rightmost side)
2. ✅ Sorted projects by most recent session
3. ✅ Updated timestamp styling to text-gray-500 with regular font weight
4. ✅ Consolidated trace tree and event details panels into single border
5. ✅ Fixed dividing line color to match card border
6. ✅ Removed "Trace Tree" heading
7. ✅ Fixed bottom gap in trace tree panel
8. ✅ Updated session header with project path

All Session 3 UI improvements are complete and functional.

## 8. Optional Next Step

**Ready for Testing and Potential Commit**

The latest changes are complete and ready for testing:
1. Refresh browser at http://localhost:5001
2. Test homepage:
   - Verify projects show "X time ago" on right side
   - Verify projects sorted by most recent activity
   - Verify timestamps use gray color with regular weight
3. Click into a session:
   - Verify unified panel border (no gap between panels)
   - Verify dividing line matches border color
   - Verify trace tree panel flushes to bottom (no gap)
   - Verify session header shows project path on right
4. Test panel scrolling behavior with 75vh height

**User's most recent request (verbatim)**:
> "Okay, and for the session ID at the top right, use uk-h4 instead. Then, on its rightmost side, include the project file path. for project file path, use just the regular weight and the standard font size with text-gray-500 as the font color."

This has been completed. The session header now shows:
- Left: Session ID with H4 (uk-h4 class)
- Right: Project path with text-gray-500 and font-normal

Once tested, consider committing with:
```
feat(ui): add timestamps to projects and improve viewer layout

- Add "X time ago" timestamps to projects and sessions
- Sort projects by most recent session activity
- Consolidate trace tree and event details into single border
- Remove trace tree heading for cleaner layout
