# Claude Code Trace Viewer - Development Summary

## 1. Primary Request and Intent

The user requested comprehensive UI improvements and enhancements to the Claude Code trace viewer application across multiple sessions:

### Session 1 - Initial Requirements:
- Display all sessions from `~/.claude/projects/` directory
- Show sessions ordered by date/time (most recent first)
- Display entire trace/conversation when clicking a session
- Make the application portable for any user
- Accurate timezone handling and conversion
- Filter out incomplete/summary-only sessions

### Session 2 - UI Enhancement Requests:
1. **Trace Tree UI Improvements**:
   - Remove circle icons from trace rows
   - Limit text to max 2 lines with proper truncation
   - Remove timestamps on the right
   - Adjust layout to 30% trace tree / 70% event details
   - Show full session ID (not truncated)
   - Remove bold text styling
   - Add keyboard navigation (up/down arrows)
   - Flush text to left without margins

2. **Tool Call/Result Enhancements**:
   - Display "tool call" in yellow for tool_use events
   - Display "tool result" in green for tool_result events with tool name lookup
   - Show tool name by finding matching tool_use_id across events

3. **Event Details Redesign**:
   - Remove Event/Timestamp/ID sections (keep Event Data at bottom)
   - Add structured Content section with scenario-based rendering
   - Add Metrics section displaying usage data
   - Add base64 image rendering support

4. **Navigation & Layout**:
   - Auto-select first trace event on page load
   - Move "Back" button to header (top left, same row as title)
   - Make hover colors consistent across home and viewer pages
   - Remove border divider below main title

### Session 3 - Homepage and Layout Improvements:
1. **Homepage Project Timestamps**:
   - Add "X time ago" timestamp to each project (rightmost side)
   - Sort projects by most recent session (descending order)
   - Use text-gray-500 with regular font weight for timestamps

2. **Panel Consolidation**:
   - Combine trace tree and event details into single bordered container
   - Remove gap between panels, use single dividing line
   - Match dividing line color to card border color
   - Remove "Trace Tree" heading from left panel
   - Fix bottom gap in trace tree panel to flush with bottom

3. **Session Header Enhancement**:
   - Use H4 with uk-h4 class for session ID
   - Add project path on rightmost side with text-gray-500
   - Use DivFullySpaced for proper spacing

4. **Panel Height Adjustment**:
   - Increase panel height from 70vh to 75vh for better visibility

### Session 4 - Thinking Event Support:
1. **Trace Tree Thinking Events**:
   - Detect events with "thinking" type in message content array
   - Display "thinking" label in blue color (text-blue-500)
   - Show first 2 lines of thinking text in trace tree

2. **Event Details Thinking Rendering**:
   - Render full thinking text in Content section
   - Use same rendering pattern as text content type

### Session 5 - Time Duration Tracking:
1. **Duration Calculation Requirements**:
   - Calculate time for thinking, assistant, tool call, and tool result events
   - Format: seconds with 2 decimal places (e.g., "2.32s")
   - Calculation method:
     - For thinking/assistant/tool_call: current timestamp - previous event timestamp
     - For tool_result: current timestamp - matching tool_use timestamp (by ID)

2. **Duration Display Location**:
   - Trace tree: Display to the right of eyebrow label (e.g., "thinking 55.49s")
   - Detail panel: Display as first metric in Metrics section

3. **Formatting Refinements**:
   - Remove space between number and unit (2.32 s â†’ 2.32s)
   - Right-align duration in trace tree using flexbox justify-between
   - Add purple color for assistant event labels

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

- **FastHTML**: Modern Python web framework for building web applications
- **MonsterUI**: UI component library for FastHTML (Card, CardContainer, CardBody components)
- **HTMX**: Dynamic content loading without page refreshes
- **Timezone-aware datetime handling**: Converting UTC timestamps to local time using dateutil
- **JSONL format**: Line-delimited JSON for session traces
- **CSS line-clamp**: Text truncation with `-webkit-line-clamp: 2`
- **Flexbox layout**: For 30/70 width distribution, panel alignment, and justify-between spacing
- **JavaScript event listeners**: Keyboard navigation and auto-selection
- **Tool ID correlation**: Matching tool_result events to tool_use events via tool_use_id
- **Scenario-based rendering**: Different UI rendering based on content type
- **Word wrapping**: `whitespace-pre-wrap` and `break-words` for proper text display
- **CSS Variables**: Using `var(--uk-border-default)` for consistent theming
- **Height vs max-height**: Understanding difference for panel sizing
- **MonsterUI Card Architecture**: Card wraps content in CardBody which adds padding
- **Content type detection**: Detecting thinking, text, tool_use, tool_result, image types in message content arrays
- **Duration calculation**: Timestamp parsing and difference calculation using dateutil.parser
- **Event type detection**: Tool_result events have type "user" despite being results

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### main.py

**Purpose**: Main application file containing the FastHTML web server and all trace viewer logic.

#### Recent Changes (Session 5 - Time Duration Tracking):

**1. TraceEvent.calculate_duration() Method**

Added comprehensive duration calculation logic:

```python
def calculate_duration(
    self, previous_event: Optional["TraceEvent"], all_events: List["TraceEvent"]
) -> Optional[float]:
    """
    Calculate duration in seconds for this event.

    For thinking/assistant/tool_call: duration = this.timestamp - previous.timestamp
    For tool_result: duration = this.timestamp - matching_tool_use.timestamp

    Returns duration in seconds or None if cannot calculate
    """
    # Parse this event's timestamp
    try:
        current_time = date_parser.parse(self.timestamp)
    except Exception:
        return None

    # For tool results, find the matching tool_use event
    if self.is_tool_result():
        tool_use_id = self.get_tool_use_id()
        if tool_use_id and all_events:
            # Find the tool_use event with matching ID
            for event in all_events:
                if "message" in event.data:
                    msg = event.data["message"]
                    if isinstance(msg.get("content"), list):
                        for item in msg["content"]:
                            if (
                                isinstance(item, dict)
                                and item.get("type") == "tool_use"
                                and item.get("id") == tool_use_id
                            ):
                                # Found matching tool_use, calculate duration
                                try:
                                    tool_use_time = date_parser.parse(
                                        event.timestamp
                                    )
                                    duration = (
                                        current_time - tool_use_time
                                    ).total_seconds()
                                    return duration
                                except Exception:
                                    return None
        return None

    # For thinking/assistant/tool_call: use previous event
    if previous_event:
        try:
            previous_time = date_parser.parse(previous_event.timestamp)
            duration = (current_time - previous_time).total_seconds()
            return duration
        except Exception:
            return None

    return None
```

**Why important**:
- Handles two different duration calculation methods
- For tool_result: Searches all events to find matching tool_use by ID
- For other events: Uses simple difference from previous event
- Returns None if calculation fails, allowing graceful handling

**2. TraceTreeNode Function - Duration Display and Assistant Color**

Updated to calculate and display duration with proper formatting:

```python
def TraceTreeNode(
    event: TraceEvent,
    session_id: str,
    all_events: Optional[List[TraceEvent]] = None,
    previous_event: Optional[TraceEvent] = None,
):
    """Flat timeline event node"""
    node_id = f"node-{event.id}"
    display_text = event.get_display_text()

    # Calculate duration for non-user events (but include tool_result which has type "user")
    duration = None
    if event.event_type != "user" or event.is_tool_result():
        duration = event.calculate_duration(previous_event, all_events or [])

    # Check if this is a thinking event
    if event.is_thinking():
        label = "thinking"
        label_color = "text-xs text-blue-500"
    # Check if this is a tool call
    elif event.is_tool_call():
        label = "tool call"
        label_color = "text-xs text-yellow-500"
    elif event.is_tool_result():
        label = "tool result"
        label_color = "text-xs text-green-500"
        # ... tool name lookup logic ...
    elif event.event_type == "assistant":
        label = "assistant"
        label_color = "text-xs text-purple-500"
    else:
        label = event.event_type
        label_color = "text-xs text-gray-500"

    # Format duration text (no space between number and unit)
    duration_text = ""
    if duration is not None:
        duration_text = f"{duration:.2f}s"

    # Create eyebrow with label and optional duration (spaced between)
    eyebrow_content = [Span(label, cls=label_color)]
    if duration_text:
        eyebrow_content.append(Span(duration_text, cls="text-xs text-gray-500"))

    return Div(
        Div(*eyebrow_content, cls="flex justify-between"),
        Span(display_text),
        cls="trace-event",
        hx_get=f"/event/{session_id}/{event.id}",
        hx_target="#detail-panel",
        id=node_id,
    )
```

**Why important**:
- Added previous_event parameter for duration calculation
- Special handling for tool_result events (type "user" but need duration)
- Added assistant color check (purple)
- Duration formatted without space (2.32s not 2.32 s)
- Flexbox justify-between for proper spacing (label left, duration right)

**3. Viewer Route - Previous Event Context**

Updated to pass previous_event to each TraceTreeNode:

```python
@rt("/viewer/{session_id}")
def viewer(session_id: str):
    # ... session file lookup ...
    trace_tree = parse_session_file(session_file)

    # Create tree nodes with previous event context for duration calculation
    tree_nodes = []
    for idx, event in enumerate(trace_tree):
        previous_event = trace_tree[idx - 1] if idx > 0 else None
        tree_nodes.append(TraceTreeNode(event, session_id, trace_tree, previous_event))

    return Layout(...)
```

**Why important**:
- Provides previous event context needed for duration calculation
- First event has None as previous_event (no duration)
- Each subsequent event gets its predecessor

**4. render_usage_metrics Function - Duration as First Metric**

Updated to display duration in Metrics section:

```python
def render_usage_metrics(usage_data: Dict[str, Any], duration: Optional[float] = None):
    """Render usage metrics section"""
    if not usage_data and duration is None:
        return None

    metrics_items = []

    # Add duration as first metric if available (no space between number and unit)
    if duration is not None:
        metrics_items.append(
            Div(
                Span("Duration: ", cls="text-gray-400"),
                Span(f"{duration:.2f}s", cls="text-white"),
                cls="mb-1",
            )
        )

    # Add usage metrics
    if usage_data:
        for key, value in usage_data.items():
            metrics_items.append(
                Div(
                    Span(f"{key}: ", cls="text-gray-400"),
                    Span(str(value), cls="text-white"),
                    cls="mb-1",
                )
            )

    return Div(
        H4("Metrics", cls="mb-2 font-bold"),
        Div(*metrics_items, cls="mb-4 p-3 bg-gray-800 rounded"),
    )
```

**Why important**:
- Accepts optional duration parameter
- Duration displayed as first metric (before usage stats)
- Format matches trace tree (no space: "55.49s")
- Shows metrics even if only duration exists (no usage data)

**5. DetailPanel Function - Duration Calculation**

Updated to calculate and pass duration to metrics:

```python
def DetailPanel(
    event: TraceEvent,
    all_events: Optional[List[TraceEvent]] = None,
    previous_event: Optional[TraceEvent] = None,
):
    """Detail panel showing event data"""
    components = []

    # Calculate duration for non-user events (but include tool_result which has type "user")
    duration = None
    if (event.event_type != "user" or event.is_tool_result()) and all_events:
        duration = event.calculate_duration(previous_event, all_events)

    # Check if event has message content
    if "message" in event.data:
        msg = event.data["message"]
        content = msg.get("content")
        usage = msg.get("usage")

        if isinstance(content, list):
            # Add metrics section if usage or duration exists
            if usage or duration is not None:
                metrics = render_usage_metrics(usage, duration)
                if metrics:
                    components.append(metrics)
```

**Why important**:
- Accepts previous_event parameter for duration calculation
- Same special handling for tool_result events
- Passes duration to render_usage_metrics
- Shows metrics if either usage or duration exists

**6. Event Route - Previous Event Lookup**

Updated to find and pass previous_event:

```python
@rt("/event/{session_id}/{id}")
def event(session_id: str, id: str):
    # ... session file lookup ...
    trace_tree = parse_session_file(session_file)
    found_event = find_event(trace_tree, id)

    if not found_event:
        return Div(P(f"Event {id} not found", cls=TextT.muted), cls="p-4")

    # Find previous event for duration calculation
    previous_event = None
    for idx, event in enumerate(trace_tree):
        if event.id == id and idx > 0:
            previous_event = trace_tree[idx - 1]
            break

    return DetailPanel(found_event, trace_tree, previous_event)
```

**Why important**:
- Finds previous event when displaying details
- Enables duration calculation in detail panel
- First event gets None (no previous event)

### summary.md

**Purpose**: Development summary documenting all features, changes, and decisions made during the project.

**Status**: Being updated with Session 5 changes (time duration tracking)

## 4. Problem Solving

### Problems Solved in Session 5:

1. **Tool Result Duration Not Showing**:
   - **Problem**: Tool_result events didn't display duration in trace tree or detail panel
   - **Root Cause**: Tool_result events have `type: "user"` in JSONL data, so they were skipped by the condition `if event.event_type != "user"`
   - **Discovery**: Used debug prints and checked JSONL data to find event type
   - **Solution**: Changed condition to `if event.event_type != "user" or event.is_tool_result()` in both TraceTreeNode and DetailPanel
   - **Verification**: Ran server with debug output and confirmed duration calculation worked

2. **Duration Calculation for Tool Results**:
   - **Problem**: Tool results need to calculate duration from matching tool_use event, not previous event
   - **Solution**: Implemented ID matching logic to find corresponding tool_use event
   - **Implementation**: Loop through all events, check message content for tool_use type, match by ID
   - **Result**: Correctly calculates time between tool_use and tool_result (e.g., 0.42s for Read tool)

3. **Duration Formatting and Spacing**:
   - **Problem**: User wanted no space between number and "s", and right-aligned duration
   - **Solution**:
     - Changed format from `f"{duration:.2f} s"` to `f"{duration:.2f}s"`
     - Added `cls="flex justify-between"` to eyebrow div
     - Removed `ml-2` margin class from duration span
   - **Result**: Label on left, duration on right, no space before "s"

4. **Assistant Label Color**:
   - **Problem**: Assistant events needed purple color to distinguish from other types
   - **Solution**: Added explicit check `elif event.event_type == "assistant"` with purple color
   - **Placement**: Added before generic else clause to catch assistant events specifically

### Problems Solved in Session 4:

1. **Thinking Event Detection**:
   - **Problem**: Need to identify events containing thinking content from LLM
   - **Solution**: Added `is_thinking()` method to check for "thinking" type in message content array
   - **Implementation**: Follows same pattern as `is_tool_call()` and `is_tool_result()`

2. **Thinking Text Display in Trace Tree**:
   - **Problem**: Need to show first 2 lines of thinking text in trace tree rows
   - **Solution**: Updated `get_display_text()` to extract thinking text and split by newlines
   - **Code**: `lines = thinking_text.split('\n')` then `return '\n'.join(lines[:2])`

3. **Thinking Event Labeling**:
   - **Problem**: Need to show "thinking" label in blue color in trace tree
   - **Solution**: Added thinking check BEFORE tool call checks in TraceTreeNode
   - **Why order matters**: Event priority determines which label is shown

4. **Thinking Content Rendering**:
   - **Problem**: Need to display full thinking text in event details panel
   - **Solution**: Added "thinking" type case in DetailPanel's content type switch
   - **Pattern**: Uses same rendering as text type for consistency

### Problems Solved in Session 3:

1. **Project Timestamp Display**:
   - **Problem**: Needed to show when each project was last active
   - **Solution**: Extract most recent session timestamp using `max(sessions, key=lambda s: s.created_at)`

2. **Project Sorting**:
   - **Problem**: Projects displayed in alphabetical order, not by activity
   - **Solution**: Sort projects dict by max session timestamp in descending order

3. **Panel Border Consolidation**:
   - **Problem**: Trace tree and event details had separate borders with gap
   - **Solution**: Wrap both panels in single CardContainer instead of separate Card components

4. **Border Color Mismatch**:
   - **Problem**: Dividing line color didn't match card border
   - **Solution**: Use CSS variable `var(--uk-border-default)` for consistent theming

5. **Trace Tree Bottom Gap**:
   - **Problem**: Left panel had visible gap at bottom
   - **Root Cause**: Using `max-height` without fixed container height
   - **Solution**: Set outer div to `height: 75vh` and inner scrollable to `max-height: 75vh`

### Previous Session Bug Fixes:

**MCP Tool Result Rendering Bug (Session 2)**:
- **Problem**: MCP tools caused Internal Server Error in Event Details panel
- **Root Cause**: `toolUseResult` has different types (dict for native, list for MCP)
- **Solution**: Added type checking to handle both formats

**Base64 Image Rendering (Session 2)**:
- **Problem**: Base64 images displayed as raw JSON
- **Solution**: Implemented image rendering in three locations (user messages, tool results, toolUseResult)

## 5. Pending Tasks

**None** - All requested features have been implemented and committed.

## 6. Current Work

**Time Duration Tracking Implementation (Session 5)**

The most recent work completed was implementing comprehensive time duration tracking for trace events:

**Changes Made** (main.py):

1. **Added calculate_duration() method** (lines 194-249):
   - Calculates duration in seconds for events
   - For thinking/assistant/tool_call: uses previous event timestamp
   - For tool_result: finds matching tool_use by ID and uses that timestamp
   - Returns Optional[float] for graceful handling of missing data

2. **Updated TraceTreeNode function** (lines 465-531):
   - Added previous_event parameter
   - Calculate duration for non-user events (plus tool_result special case)
   - Format duration without space: `f"{duration:.2f}s"`
   - Added assistant purple color check
   - Use flexbox justify-between for label/duration spacing

3. **Updated viewer route** (lines 927-933):
   - Create tree nodes with previous event context
   - Loop through events with index to get previous event
   - Pass all needed parameters to TraceTreeNode

4. **Updated render_usage_metrics** (lines 543-576):
   - Accept optional duration parameter
   - Display duration as first metric
   - Format without space: "Duration: 55.49s"

5. **Updated DetailPanel function** (lines 580-603):
   - Accept previous_event parameter
   - Calculate duration with same logic as TraceTreeNode
   - Pass duration to render_usage_metrics

6. **Updated event route** (lines 1042-1049):
   - Find previous event in trace_tree
   - Pass to DetailPanel for duration calculation

**Formatting Refinements**:
- Removed space between number and "s" (2.32 s â†’ 2.32s)
- Right-aligned duration using flexbox justify-between
- Added purple color for assistant labels

**Commits Made**:
- "feat(viewer): add thinking event detection and display" (264d0f1)
- "feat(viewer): add time duration display for trace events" (2729093)
- "style(viewer): improve duration formatting and add assistant color" (2dcd559)
